    "What is a Large Language Model (LLM)? How is it different from traditional software?\n",
    "- **Answer:LLM is an AI that is trained off of text data. It's different from traditional software because it learns almost like a human.**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question 01\n",
    "What does it mean to \"prompt\" an LLM? Why is prompting important?\n",
    "- **Answer:Prompt in LLM is when you give the model a specific task to do such as what it's role is supposed to be. Prmpting is important so the model knows what exactly it's doing.**\n",

    "##### Question 02\n",
    "Research \"prompt engineering.\" What are some techniques for getting better responses from LLMs?\n",
    "- **Answer:Some techniques for getting better respones from LLMs are being specific with it and starting simple by not giving it prior examples. Another thing soemthing called meta prompting which is telling the model to create it's own prompt first**\n",

    "##### Question 03\n",
    "What are some ethical concerns with customizing AI behavior?\n",

      "2. What are the most common types of photosynthesis in plants?\n",
      "   - Plants use chlorophyll to capture light energy and convert it into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. How does photosynthesis regulate plant growth and evolution?\n",
      "   - Photosynthesis is the primary mechanism by which plants reproduce and grow, as it allows them to convert light energy into organic matter through the process of cellular respiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. What are the benefits of photosynthesis for organisms?\n",
      "   - Photosynthesis provides the primary source of energy for photosynthetic organisms, allowing them to grow and reproduce.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. What are the limitations of photosynthesis?\n",
      "   - Photosynthesis is not perfect, and some of the energy produced is lost as heat, which can lead to plant heat stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. What is the difference between photosynthesis and respiration?\n",
      "   - Photosynthesis is a process where light energy is used to split water molecules into oxygen and carbohydrates, while respiration is a process where cellular respiration converts glucose into ATP and other molecules.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. How do plants use light as a source of energy in photosynthesis?\n",
      "   - The light energy is collected by chlorophyll, which is a pigment located in the chloroplasts of plant cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. What are the three main stages of photosynthesis?\n",
      "   - The first stage of photosynthesis is called the light-dependent reactions, where a water molecule is split into oxygen and a carbohydrate molecule, using the energy from light.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. What are the key molecules involved in photosynthesis?\n",
      "   - Chlorophyll is the primary pigment involved in photosynthesis, which is responsible for absorbing light energy and converting it into chemical energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. What is the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis?\n",
      "   - Chlorophyll is the main pigment in plant cells responsible for the process of photosynthesis. It absorbs light energy and converts it into chemical energy through the process of cellular respiration.\n",

      "🤖 Response: Give me 3 study tips. The first tip is to take your time. Sometimes, we get so caught up in the idea that we need to cram everything into one day or one week that we forget to take the time to do our homework. Spend time on each topic, not just one. The second tip is to establish good study habits. This means not doing homework right after school, or right before sleep. Establish a regular study schedule, and try to stick to it. The third tip is to set realistic goals. Sometimes, we set too high of goals and end up not getting anything done. Instead, set achievable goals, and give yourself time to accomplish them. Remember, the most important tool in your study toolbox is a good sleep schedule. If you can’t go to bed at a reasonable hour, try to establish a bedtime routine to help you wind down before bed.
